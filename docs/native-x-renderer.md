# NativeXRenderer in Mad Riders (work in progress)

[NativeXRenderer](https://github.com/ElGuslml/NativeXRenderer) draws the game's
Direct3D calls on the host (Vulkan, DiligentCore) instead of emulating the Xenos GPU. It is the default
renderer since 2026-11-02 (`native_x_renderer = true`, F1 > Renderer): the ReXGlue SDK stays v0.10.0 (built
from source with NativeXRenderer's changes), and its Xenos path is the alternative and the fallback.

## Build
- `thirdparty/native_x_renderer`: submodule (pinned commit), with DiligentCore inside it.
- `patches/rexglue-sdk/`: NativeXRenderer's eight SDK changes (draw observer, sync-only command processor,
  queries, gamma, fractional scale, renderer thread signals, RequestRanges, swap count), taken from
  ElGuslml/rexglue-sdk's `recomp` branch (changes 26-33), plus change 19 (lazy resolves: the texture cache's
  `TryLoadTextureDataFromResolveCache`, which NativeXRenderer overrides; its D3D12 part is off by default). They
  apply cleanly to v0.10.0.
- CMake: `-DMADRIDERS_NATIVE_X_RENDERER=ON -DREXSDK_DIR=<patched SDK source tree>`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/build-windows-nxr.yml` (artifact `mad_riders-nxr-win-amd64`).

## The executable
XDK 2.0.21076 (newer than every game NativeXRenderer has mapped: 2099, 2417, 5426, 7978). The D3D library is at
`0x82E5B000`-`0x82E84000`.

Device layout: XDK 7978's up to the register shadow; fence counter +11036, write-back block +11024, flag bytes
+11068 (7978's + 128); vertex declaration +12240; the current-object block 7978's + 368 (index buffer, targets,
streams, textures, viewport, shaders, predication confirmed by their setters). BeginTiling/EndTiling exist
(82E76A30/82E77198 likely) but the engine never calls them.

## Verify results
- 2026-11-02, first run with Swap as the frame end (only draws and shaders hooked): 96.8 % of 588 matched
  draws; 205 calls never executed (the BeginVertices taken for DrawVerticesUP, calls whose packets crossed an
  unhooked segment kick); 15 packets written outside hooked calls (clears); mismatches in SQ_PROGRAM_CNTL /
  SQ_INTERPOLATOR_CNTL and the program hashes right after them. Then everything above was hooked.
- 2026-11-02, all entry points hooked, in a race (frame 2566): **458 of 458 matched draws fully match (100 %)**,
  0 calls read incompletely, no register/constant/fetch/program mismatches. The 14 unmatched packets are the
  library's own Clear (9) and Resolve (5) draws. 226 of 684 CPU draw calls had no GPU execution in the window
  (to look at). No tiling, no memexport, no queries in the frame.
- Every Resolve in a race goes through the engine's wrapper (return address 0x82761F30, its callers 0x82762690
  and 0x82762744): `scene_resolve_caller` needs the outer caller (D65) to pick the scene copy.

## First frames (2026-11-02)
- `--native_x_renderer=true`: menus and races draw as on the Xenos path; 70 -> 100+ FPS at the same spots (1080p,
  1.5x of 1280x720). First-run hitches were pipeline compilation: the second run loaded the stored 456 pipelines
  and its worst frame over 600 was 11 ms.
- The garage's rider showed only helmet, gloves and boots. Its body (decl 0x405abfa0) is one draw of 71322
  indices: the library splits it into DRAW_INDX packets of 65532 + 5790 indices inside one call (garage verify:
  VGT_DMA_BASE/SIZE/DRAW_INITIATOR differ for the call executed twice), and NativeXRenderer draws one packet per
  call, the last piece. Fix: the DrawIndexedVertices hook issues list draws over 65532 indices as several calls
  while NativeXRenderer is on.

## First-run hitches (2026-11-02)
New players reported bad hitching. The scene is drawn into 1280x672 targets, not the 1280x720 output, so
NativeXRenderer's D101 rule (offscreen passes wait for their pipelines instead of being skipped) applied to every
scene draw: each new pipeline stalled the frame on a first run. `patches/native_x_renderer/0001` adds
`Profile::scene_width/scene_height`; the profile sets 1280x672, so scene draws are skipped for the frame or two
their pipeline takes, as in other games, and only the true offscreen passes wait.

## Testing (needs the player's PC)
1. `mad_riders.exe --native_x_renderer_trace=true`: play a race; F9 dumps a frame into the log.
2. `mad_riders.exe --native_x_renderer_verify=true`: F10 verifies a frame; the report lands in the log about
   10 frames later.
Send the log.
3. `mad_riders.exe --native_x_renderer=true`: the renderer itself (first frames, 2026-11-02).
